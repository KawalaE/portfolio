        I'm a Frontend Developer with a background in Automatic Control and
        Robotics, where I was first introduced to programming. After earning my
        BEng, I co-founded an e-commerce company. Around that time, I also
        rediscovered my passion for coding and began developing my skills
        further through online courses and tutorials.{" "}
